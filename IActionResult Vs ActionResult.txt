IActionResult is an interface and ActionResult is an implementation of that interface.

ActionResults is an abstract class and action results like ViewResult, PartialViewResult, JsonResult, etc., derive from ActionResult.

IActionResult is an interface, we can create a custom response as a return, when you use ActionResult you can return only predefined ones for returning a View or a resource. 
With IActionResult we can return a response, or error as well. On the other hand, ActionResult is an abstract class, and you would need to make a custom class that inherits.
