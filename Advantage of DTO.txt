DTO, stands for Data Transfer Object, is a design pattern conceived to reduce the number of calls when working with remote interfaces.
The advantage of using DTOs, is that they can help hiding implementation details of domain objects (aka. entities). Exposing entities through 
endpoints can become a security issue if we do not carefully handle what properties can be changed through what operations.
