1) It provides better maintainability as all the codes depend on layers or the center.

2) It provides better testability as the unit test can be created for separate layers without an effect of other modules of the application.
3) It develops a loosely coupled application as the outer layer of the application always communicates with the inner layer via interfaces.
4) Any concrete implantation would be provided to the application at run time.
5) Domain entities are core and center part. It can have access to both the database and UI layers.
6) The internal layers never depend on the external layer. The code that may have changed should be part of an external layer.
