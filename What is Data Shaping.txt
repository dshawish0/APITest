What is Data Shaping
Data shaping is a great way to reduce the amount of traffic sent from the API to the client. 
It enables the consumer of the API to select (shape) the data by choosing the fields through the query string.

What we mean by this is something like:
https://localhost:5001/api/owner?fields=name,dateOfBirth

This would tell the API to return a list of owners with ONLY the Name and DateOfBirth fields of the owner entity. 
In our case, the owner entity doesn’t have too many fields to choose from, but you can see how this can be very helpful when an entity has a lot of fields in it. It’s not that uncommon.

By giving the consumer a way to select just the fields it needs, we can potentially reduce the stress on the API. 
On the other hand, this is not something that every API needs, so we need to think carefully and decide whether we should implement its implementation has a bit of reflection going on.
