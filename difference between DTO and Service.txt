Data Transfer Object
DTO is an object that carries data between processes. When you're working with a remote interface, 
each call it is expensive. As a result you need to reduce the number of calls. 
The solution is to create a Data Transfer Object that can hold all the data for the call. It needs to be serializable to go across the connection. 
Usually an assembler is used on the server side to transfer data between the DTO and any domain objects. It's often little more than a bunch of fields and the getters and setters for them.

Service
Service objects are doing the work that the application needs to do for the domain you're working with. 
It involves calculations based on inputs and stored data, validation of any data that comes in from the presentation, 
and figuring out exactly what data source logic to dispatch, depending on commands received from the presentation.

A Service Layer defines an application's boundary and its set of available operations from the perspective of interfacing client layers. 
It encapsulates the application's business logic, controlling transactions and coordinating responses in the implementation of its operations.
